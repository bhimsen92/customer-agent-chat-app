Capacity Estimation
===================
Let's say we get 100,000 customers using our chat/agent service. Each customer can exchange on average 50 messages per day.

So total messages: 100,000 * 50 = 5,000,000/day

Each message size can be 100 bytes and we want to keep the messages around for at least 12 months.

Total database capacity required per day: 5,000,000 * 100 = 0.465GB/day

Total needed capacity for 12 months: 0.465 * 365 = 170GB/year

Total message bandwidth = 5.65Kb/second.
